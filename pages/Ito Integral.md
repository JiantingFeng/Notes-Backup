- Stochastic Process: $$X_t: [0, T]\times \Omega\to \mathbb{R}$$
- We have SDE $$\mathrm{d}X_t = \mu \mathrm{d}t + \sigma \mathrm{d}W_t$$, where $$W_t$$ is Wiener process, drift $$\mu = \mu(t, X_t)$$ and variance $$\sigma = \sigma(t, X_t)$$
- Compared to ODE, the solution can be written in the form $$X_t = X_0 + \int_{0}^t \mu \mathrm{d}s+ \int_{0}^t\sigma \mathrm{d}W_s$$ called Ito integral
	- The first term (drift term) $$\int_0^t\mu \mathrm{d}s$$ is just a Riemann integral
	- The second term (diffusion term) $$\int_0^t\sigma \mathrm{d} W_s$$ is Ito integral w.r.t. Wiener process.
- Example, Geometry Brownian Motion
	- $$\mathrm{d}S_t = \mu S_tdt + \sigma S_t \mathrm{d}W_t$$
	- where $$\mu$$ and $$\sigma$$ are constant term
- Consider we want to pricing a financial contract, i.e.
	- $$C_t = f(S_t, t)$$ where $$S_t$$ is the underling stock price
	- It can be an European call option, etc.
	- We are interested in the dynamics of it.
	- Consider small $$\mathrm{d} t$$ then use taylor expansion
	- $$\mathrm{d}f(S_t) = f( S_{t+\mathrm{d} t)}$$
