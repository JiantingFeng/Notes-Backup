- Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension is a measure on boolean function
	- Boolean function is used in binary classification
	- Which assign each data point a binary label
- The Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension of a class $$f$$ is the maximum number of points that $$f$$ shatters.
- Example:
	- Let $$f$$ be all linear function in $$\mathbb{R}^2$$
	- Then $$vc(f) = 3$$, because we can choose $$4$$ points that $$f$$ cannot shatter
