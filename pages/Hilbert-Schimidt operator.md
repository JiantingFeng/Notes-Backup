- Hilbert-Schmidt operator is a bounded operator $$A: H\to\ H$$ that acts on a Hilbert space $$H$$ with finite **Hilbert-Schmidt norm**
	- $$\lVert A\rVert_\text{HS}^2 = \sum_{i\in I}\lVert Ae_i\rVert_{H}^2$$
	- where $$e_i$$ is an orthogonal basis, and $$I$$ need not to be countable. *However, the sum on the right must contain at most countably many non-zero terms to have meaning.*
