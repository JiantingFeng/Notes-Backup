- This concept is introduced to solve following question:
	- Let $$x$$ and $$y$$ be random variables defined on a topological space $$\mathcal{X}$$, with respective Borel probability measure $$p$$ and $$q$$. Given observations $$X = \{X_1,\cdots, X_n\}$$ and $$Y=\{Y_1, \cdots, Y_m\}$$ i.i.d. from $$p$$ and $$q$$, respectively. **How can we decided whether** $$p\neq q$$
- First we have following lemma,
	- Let $$(\mathcal X, d)$$ be a metric space, and $$p, q$$ be two Borel probability measures defined on $$\mathcal X$$. Then $$p=q$$ iff $$\mathbb{E}_X[f(X)]=\mathbb{E}_Y[f(Y)]$$ for all $$f\in C(\mathcal X)$$. Where $$C(\mathcal X)$$ denoted the space of bounded  continuous functions on $$\mathcal X$$
- Definition: Let $$\mathcal F$$ be a class of functionals o $$\mathcal X$$. We define *maximal mean discrepancy* (MMD) as
	- $$\textrm{MMD}[\mathcal F, p, q] = \sup_{f\in\mathcal F}\left(\mathbb{E}_X[f(x)] - \mathbb{E}_Y(f(y)\right)$$
	- This is also referred as **integral probability metric**.
	- A biased empirical estimation is
		- $$\textrm{MMD}_b[\mathcal F, X, Y] = \sup_{f\in\mathcal F}\left(\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^mf(x_i) - \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nf(y_i)\right)$$
- Here, we restrict the function class in a **reproducing kernel Hilbert space** $$\mathcal H$$
