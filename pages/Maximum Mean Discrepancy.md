- This concept is introduced to solve following question:
	- Let $$x$$ and $$y$$ be random variables defined on a topological space $$\mathcal{X}$$, with respective Borel probability measure $$p$$ and $$q$$. Given observations $$X = \{X_1,\cdots, X_n\}$$ and $$Y=\{Y_1, \cdots, Y_m\}$$ i.i.d. from $$p$$ and $$q$$, respectively. H
