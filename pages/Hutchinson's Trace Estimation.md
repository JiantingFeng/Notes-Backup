- Given a matrix $$\bm{A}\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$$, if we want to compute its trace, then we can use this trick, called *Hutchinson's Trace Estimation*.
- $$\mathrm{tr}\left(\bm A\right) = \mathrm{tr}\left(\bm A\mathbb{E}[\varepsilon \varepsilon^T]\right)=\mathbb{E}\left[\mathrm{tr}(\bm{A}\varepsilon\varepsilon^T)\right]=\mathbb{E}\left[\mathrm{tr}(\varepsilon^T\bm{A}\varepsilon)\right] = \mathbb{E}\left[\varepsilon^T\bm{A}\varepsilon\right]$$
- where $$\varepsilon\sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1)$$
- then you can use Monte Carlo method to approximate the expectation.
- But, why don't we directly calculate the trace?
- Suppose you need to calculate the trace of a matrix function, i.e. $$\mathrm{tr}(\exp \bm A), \mathrm{tr}(\log \bm A)$$, etc
- With traditional way, you should go through the following steps
	- Calculate the Jordan canonical form of $$\bm A$$. Indeed, in numerical computation, every matrix is diagonalizable since all eigenvalues are different (approximation error). Then the cost of this step takes $$\mathcal{O}(n^3)$$, the diag. form is denoted as $$\bm \Lambda$$
	- Calculate $$f(\bm \Lambda)$$, and add them up to calculate trace, which takes $$\mathcal{O}(n)$$
	- Total time complexity is $$\mathcal{O}(n^3)$$
