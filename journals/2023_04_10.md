- Vector database
	 - A vector database is a storage system optimized for **managing and searching high-dimensional vectors**, which are common in machine learning, AI, and multimedia applications.

	 - E.g. Image Similarity Search
		 - **Preprocessing**: Preprocess the images in your dataset by resizing, normalizing, and performing any necessary data augmentation.

		 - **Feature extraction**: Let $$\bm{x}$$ be query image, using a standard ResNet as encoder, we get a $$1024\dim$$ feature embedding vector $$\bm{x}_\text{emb}$$.

		 - **Indexing (Optional)**: Insert the feature vectors $$\bm{x}_\text{emb}$$ extracted from the images into the vector database's index. Ensure that you also store metadata, such as image IDs or file paths, so that you can later retrieve the original images corresponding to the feature vectors.

		 - **Querying**:Use the vector database to search for the most similar feature vectors in the index, typically using k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) search. Retrieve the metadata associated with the matched feature vectors to identify the corresponding similar images.
